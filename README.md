Here’s a cleaner, more polished version that keeps your original idea but sounds more confident and hackathon-ready:

# 🌱 Green Eats

**Boilermake Hackathon 2025 Project**

## Inspiration

Healthy eating can be hard—especially for people who avoid vegetables altogether. Many of my friends fall into this category, which inspired me to build an app that evaluates how “green” a meal is by analyzing a photo of the plate. The goal is to make healthy eating more visual, measurable, and fun.

## What is Green Eats?

**Green Eats** is a mobile application that tracks the percentage of green foods on your plate—an intuitive and accessible way to estimate how healthy each meal is.

**Key features include:**

* 📷 **Camera-based analysis** using photos of meals
* 📊 **Daily logging** to track eating habits over time

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Frontend

* **React Native**

### Backend

* **Python + Flask**

---

## Challenges Faced

Setting up the backend was the biggest challenge. Due to time constraints and unfamiliarity with backend configuration, I wasn’t able to fully connect it by the submission deadline.

---

## Accomplishments I'm Proud Of

* Designed and implemented a functional React Native frontend
* Developed a clear concept for a health-focused food tracking app
* Learned how to structure a mobile app project from scratch

---

## What I Learned

* The basic folder structure and workflow of a React Native project
* The importance of early backend setup and testing

---

## What’s Next

If I continue developing **Green Eats**, I plan to:

* Integrate **Discord logging** so users can share progress and stay motivated together
* Improve food recognition accuracy and expand beyond just green foods
* Fully deploy and connect the backend for real-time analysis
